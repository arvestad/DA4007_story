# A DA4007 fairytale
Once upon a time, by a lake called Brunnsviken, there was an old castle made of yellow bricks.
The leaves were falling.
Frost on the ground.
People are still swimming in the lake. 
One of them got bit by a sea monster.

On a cold autumn day, a queen opened the castle window and birds flew in.
